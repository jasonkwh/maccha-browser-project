Maccha is intended to revolutionize the web browsing experiences on iOS phablets.

## Setting up with CocoaPods

We used CocoaPods to integrate our projects and third-party libraries. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

You can install CocoaPods with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to your directory by cd / mkdir commands, then use the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonkwh/maccha-browser-project
$ cd maccha-browser-project
$ pod install
```

Lastly, open 'maccha.xcworkspace' by Xcode.
