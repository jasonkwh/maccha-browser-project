## Setting up with CocoaPods

We used CocoaPods to integrate our projects and third-party libraries. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

You have to install CocoaPods with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate your directory by cd / mkdir commands, then use the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonkwh/quaza-browser-project
$ cd quaza-browser-project
$ pod install
```

Lastly, open 'Quaza.xcworkspace' by Xcode.
